        "2. Apply copper-based sprays every 7-10 days to help control the disease.\n"
        "3. Avoid overhead watering to reduce leaf wetness and the potential for bacterial spread.\n"
        "4. Practice crop rotation to reduce the presence of the bacteria in the soil.\n"
        "5. Use disease-free seeds and resistant plant varieties if available."
    ),
    "Early Blight": (
        "1. Apply fungicides such as chlorothalonil or copper-based products at the first sign of disease and continue at regular intervals.\n"
        "2. Remove and destroy infected leaves to reduce the spread of the fungus.\n"
        "3. Mulch around the base of plants to reduce soil splash onto leaves, which can spread the pathogen.\n"
        "4. Practice crop rotation and avoid planting tomatoes or potatoes in the same location each year.\n"
        "5. Ensure good air circulation by spacing plants properly and pruning excess foliage."

    ),
    "Iron Deficiency": (
        "1. Apply iron chelates to the soil or as a foliar spray to correct iron deficiency.\n"
        "2. Adjust soil pH to between 6.0 and 6.5, as iron is more available to plants in slightly acidic soils.\n"
        "3. Avoid overwatering, as waterlogged soils can inhibit iron uptake.\n"
        "4. Ensure proper fertilization, avoiding excessive phosphorus, which can interfere with iron absorption.\n"

        "3. Use yellow sticky traps to monitor and control adult leaf miners.\n"
        "4. Encourage natural predators, such as parasitic wasps, which can help control leaf miner populations.\n"
        "5. Practice crop rotation to disrupt the life cycle of the pests."
    ),
    "Mosaic Virus": (
        "1. Remove and destroy infected plants to prevent the spread of the virus.\n"
        "2. Control aphids and other insect vectors that can transmit the virus using insecticidal soaps or oils.\n"

        "5. Use virus-free seeds and resistant varieties if available."
    ),
    "Septoria": (
        "1. Use disease-free seeds and transplants to prevent introducing the pathogen.\n"
        "2. Apply fungicides such as chlorothalonil or mancozeb at the first sign of disease and continue at regular intervals.\n"
        "3. Remove and destroy infected leaves to reduce the spread of the fungus.\n"
        "4. Practice crop rotation and avoid planting tomatoes in the same location each year.\n"
        "5. Ensure good air circulation by spacing plants properly and pruning excess foliage."
    ),
    "Spider Mites": (
        "1. Spray plants with water to dislodge spider mites and reduce their numbers.\n"
        "2. Apply miticides or insecticidal soaps to control spider mite populations.\n"
        "3. Introduce natural predators, such as ladybugs or predatory mites, to help manage spider mite infestations.\n"
        "4. Maintain adequate humidity around plants, as spider mites thrive in dry conditions.\n"
        "5. Regularly inspect plants for early signs of spider mite activity and take prompt action."
    ),
    "Yellow Leaf Curl Virus": (
        "1. Remove and destroy infected plants to prevent the spread of the virus.\n"
        "2. Control whiteflies, the primary vector of the virus, using insecticidal soaps, oils, or yellow sticky traps.\n"
        "3. Avoid planting tomatoes near crops that are hosts for whiteflies.\n"
        "4. Use virus-free transplants and resistant varieties if available.\n"
